## 📖 Introduction
Plant diseases pose a significant threat to global food security and local biodiversity. Traditional diagnosis relies on expert knowledge, which is often expensive or inaccessible. **LeafyCare** bridges this gap using AI-based image recognition to detect diseases early and provide verified maintenance guidelines through a user-friendly mobile interface.

## ⚠️ Problem Statement
- **Expert Dependency:** Diagnosis often requires specialists who aren't always available.
- **Fragmented Data:** Reliable plant care info is scattered across various unverified sources.
- **Manual Errors:** Visual identification by non-experts is prone to high error rates.
- **Barrier to Entry:** Beginners lack the tools to monitor plant health effectively.

## ✅ Proposed Solution
LeafyCare offers a comprehensive health monitoring system that:
1. **Identifies** diseases using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).
2. **Maps** predictions to structured care data (Soil, Sunlight, Water).
3. **Retrieves** real-time verified data via external Plant APIs.
4. **Simplifies** the user experience through a clean, native Android UI.

## 🚀 Features
- **AI-Based Detection:** TensorFlow-powered classification of thousands of labeled plant images.
- **Detailed Care Guides:** Access growth patterns, soil requirements, and maintenance schedules.
- **Smart Search:** Case-insensitive search optimized for performance (triggers after 3 characters).
- **Secure Authentication:** Integrated login system with local SQLite support.
- **External API Integration:** Real-time fetching of botanical data to ensure accuracy.
